### Background Story
_High school students learning Mandarin often struggle with accurate pronunciation, leading to misunderstandings in real-life conversations. Many of them want to prepare their Mandarin daily conversation  specifically for transactional conversations because these are common and important in real-life interactions. There is an opportunity to design an interactive solution that helps students practice and receive real-time, predictive feedback on their pronunciation accuracy in these contexts, enabling more confident and effective communication with native speakers._

- **Synthesis**: _We learned that learning Chinese pronounciation is hard as a beginner due to its variety of vowels and tones but currently Chinese language act as a second international language making it one of the most wanted to be learned language._
- **Challenge**: _Helping user on learning basic mandarin pronunciation as a beginner with the help of sound ML experience_ 
- **Solution**: _JaChi is an interactive app that helps users master Mandarin pronunciation through real-life bargaining scenarios. Designed to make language learning practical and engaging, JaChi focuses on accurate tones, natural speech, and cultural contextâ€”so users can speak confidently and convincingly in everyday situations. _
- **Role**: _Frontend Developer_
- **Interesting Thing**:
    - _The color seem not match with the purpose of language learning application._
    - _The data model accuracy is not that good, the result shows overfit._
    - _The time management is really fitted due to long decision making in deciding user persona and smaller data needs_
